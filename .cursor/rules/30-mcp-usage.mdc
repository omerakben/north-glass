Tooling discipline:

- **Context7 MCP** — when you need up-to-date library docs or examples, invoke Context7 to fetch version-specific, authoritative snippets. Prefer this over guessing or stale memory.
- **Sequential Thinking MCP** — produce/refresh the plan *before* coding and when scope changes.
- **Playwright MCP** — after implementation, validate the main PRD flows (desktop and mobile). Save output (screens, snapshots, logs) to the PR for audit.

Rules of evidence:

- Cite @PRD.md line/section numbers in your plan and PR.
- If an MCP response conflicts with PRD, PRD wins—open a PCR rather than improvising.
- No assumptions. If something isn’t in PRD, escalate with a PCR draft and stop coding.
